# MontyHallProblemInR

You're on a game show. There are three doors.
Behind one, there is a car.
Behind the others, there are goats.
You pick a door (say, #1). The host knows where the car is. She
opens a door which has a goat behind it (say, #3).
The host now gives you the choice of staying with your original
choice, or switching to the remaining unopened door (say, #2).
Is it to your advantage to switch? 
The Montystay.R will give you the probability of winning the car if you do not switch.
The Montyswitch.R will give you the probability of winning the car if you do switch.
